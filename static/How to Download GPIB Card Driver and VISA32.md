## What is GPIB?
 
GPIB stands for General Purpose Interface Bus, which is a standard for connecting and controlling multiple instruments from a computer. GPIB was originally developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in the 1960s and later standardized by IEEE as IEEE-488. GPIB allows you to send commands and receive data from your instruments using a common syntax and protocol.
 
## What is VISA?
 
VISA stands for Virtual Instrument Software Architecture, which is a standard for software that communicates with instruments. VISA provides a common API (Application Programming Interface) for different types of instruments, such as GPIB, Ethernet, serial, USB, etc. VISA also provides functions for instrument discovery, configuration, and error handling.
 
## What is NI-VISA?
 
NI-VISA is a software library that implements the VISA standard for National Instruments (NI) hardware and software products. NI-VISA provides support for customers using Ethernet, GPIB, serial, USB, and other types of instruments. NI-VISA also integrates with other NI software products, such as LabVIEW, TestStand, FlexLogger, etc.
 
## What is NI-488.2?
 
NI-488.2 is a software driver that provides support for customers using NI GPIB controllers and NI embedded controllers with GPIB ports. NI-488.2 enables you to communicate with your GPIB instruments using high-level commands or low-level functions. NI-488.2 also supports various features, such as device recognition, interrupt handling, DMA transfers, etc.
